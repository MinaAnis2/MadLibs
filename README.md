# MadLibs
MadLibs game done in Python using NLTK 3.4.1
Program was intended to be able to allow the user to input the number of verbs, nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and adverbs they would like to change from their selected passage. From this, the user would input their desired words of choice, without knowing where in the passage these words would be placed.  After completing all the needed inputs, the finished passage would be displayed for the user to read, and possibly, find entertainment from juxtaposing their inputs. Program could use some tweaking but was used as an intro to using the natural language toolkit. 
Screenshots of code input and output have been provided.
